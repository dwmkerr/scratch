Good script. See my markdown below. Update it to default to the file at (in order):

~/.flow.md ./flow.md

Update the script to use the markdown checkbox to determine whether or not to show the commads. Below the heading, write +2 hidden (e.g. if two commands hidden). The script didn't show my later command bindings, please add them.

Update the script so that I can move the cursor up and down, there should be a prompt a the bottom starting with ":" that enables me to enter commands as well. The only command is "q" for quit. Above the prompt note the available commands.

Here's the updated markdown

## Global

- [x] ⌘ + Enter: Toggle iTerm fullscreen
- [x] ⌥ + Space: Show/Hide iTerm
- [ ] ^ + Space: Switch input (e.g. UK -> Chinese)
- [x] ⌘ + Y: OpenAI 

## Chrome

- [x] ⌘ + Shift + L - Auto-login (bitwarden)


## Vim
